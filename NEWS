* Unreleased
** =udev-monitor-add-filter!=: Make "devtype" parameter optional
Now =udev-monitor-add-filter!= can be called without the =devtype= parameter
so the UDEV monitor will match all events for the specified subsystem.

Implemented by Maxim Cournoyer <maxim.cournoyer@gmail.com>.
** =make-udev-monitor=: Now allows to set a filter without device type
When =#:filter= passed without device type all events with the specified
subsystem will be handled.

Implemented by Maxim Cournoyer <maxim.cournoyer@gmail.com>.
** New 'pre-inst-env' wrapper script
Add a 'pre-inst-env' wrapper script to test library before installing.

Implemented by Maxim Cournoyer <maxim.cournoyer@gmail.com>.
** =guix.scm=: Improve
*** Patch sources to fix the Guile extension path
Fixed by Zheng Junjie <zhengjunjie@iscas.ac.cn>.
*** Fix cross-building
Tested on =aarch64-linux-gnu=.
** =examples/device-listener.scm=: Improve
Now the program uses more portable shebang.

Thanks to Maxim Cournoyer <maxim.cournoyer@gmail.com>.
** Implement GNU Guix workflows for GitHub CI
Targets are:
- =x86_64-linux-gnu=
- =aarch64-linux-gnu=
** Add tests
** Update and improve the documentation
- Document how GNU Guix can be used to develop or install guile-udev.
- Refine documentation for the =make-udev-monitor= procedure.
- Show the existing complete device listener example content.

  Thanks to Maxim Cournoyer <maxim.cournoyer@gmail.com>.

* Changes in version 0.2.4 (2022-12-27)
** Bugfix: Check every string that comes from the udev for NULL
Guile-Udev would always fail with obscure errors when the procedures from the
udev library return a NULL pointer instead of an expected C string.  Now there
are extra checks for NULL pointers before converting C strings to Scheme
objects; in that way Guile-Udev will fail with more meaningful errors when
faced with a NULL pointer.
** Add a GNU Guix recipe (=guix.scm=)

* Changes in version 0.2.3 (2022-01-03)
** Bugfix: Compile and install Guile modules
   Guile-Udev 0.2.2 had an error in Automake files due to which GNU Autotools
   would ignore Guile modules altogether.  Now this error should be fixed.

   Reported by by Mathieu Othacehe in
   <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-patches/2022-01/msg00102.html>

* Changes in version 0.2.2 (2021-12-31)
** Remove requirement for 'whereis' command
   Guile-Udev required 'whereis' from 'util-linux' package to find
   'guile-snarf' command.  Now this dependency is removed.

* Changes in version 0.2.1 (2021-12-26)
** Fix compilation errors on aarch64
   The naming conflict between variable 'fd_set' and 'typedef(fd_set)' can
   cause compilation errors on aarch64, just like in this issue reported on
   C++: <http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/unices/108481/>

   Now this problem should be fixed.

   Reported by: Antlers <antlers@github.com> in
   <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-udev/pull/1>
** Bump libtool library version
   The library version wasn't properly updated in the 0.2.0 release. Now it is
   bumped to 1:1:0 according to libtool recommendations:
   <https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html>

   Old programs that use Guile-UDev 0.1.0 or 0.2.0 can use the new version
   0.2.1 as a drop-in replacement.

* Changes in version 0.2.0 (2021-04-11)
** Changes in (udev monitor)
*** Allow to specify 'select' timeout
   The module now provides 'udev-monitor-set-timeout!' procedure that allows
   to specify timeout for calls to 'select'.
*** New procedure 'make-udev-monitor'
    The module now provides two procedures for creating udev monitors:
    low-level '%make-udev-monitor' and high-level 'make-udev-monitor' procedure
    that allows to specify monitor parameters by means of keywords.
*** New procedure 'udev-monitor-set-error-callback!'
    This procedure allows to set a callback that will be called on errors when
    scanner is started.
*** 'make-udev-monitor' now allows to set an error callback
    This callback will be called on errors during device scanning. It defaults
    to a procedure that prints error messages to stderr.
 
* Changes in version 0.1.0 (2020-07-31)
** Release of the first version of Guile-Udev
