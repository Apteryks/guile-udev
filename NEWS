* Changes in version 0.2.2 (2021-12-31)
** Remove requirement for 'whereis' command
   Guile-Udev required 'whereis' from 'util-linux' package to find
   'guile-snarf' command.  Now this dependency is removed.

* Changes in version 0.2.1 (2021-12-26)
** Fix compilation errors on aarch64
   The naming conflict between variable 'fd_set' and 'typedef(fd_set)' can
   cause compilation errors on aarch64, just like in this issue reported on
   C++: <http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/unices/108481/>

   Now this problem should be fixed.

   Reported by: Antlers <antlers@github.com> in
   <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-udev/pull/1>
** Bump libtool library version
   The library version wasn't properly updated in the 0.2.0 release. Now it is
   bumped to 1:1:0 according to libtool recommendations:
   <https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html>

   Old programs that use Guile-UDev 0.1.0 or 0.2.0 can use the new version
   0.2.1 as a drop-in replacement.

* Changes in version 0.2.0 (2021-04-11)
** Changes in (udev monitor)
*** Allow to specify 'select' timeout
   The module now provides 'udev-monitor-set-timeout!' procedure that allows
   to specify timeout for calls to 'select'.
*** New procedure 'make-udev-monitor'
    The module now provides two procedures for creating udev monitors:
    low-level '%make-udev-monitor' and high-level 'make-udev-monitor' procedure
    that allows to specify monitor parameters by means of keywords.
*** New procedure 'udev-monitor-set-error-callback!'
    This procedure allows to set a callback that will be called on errors when
    scanner is started.
*** 'make-udev-monitor' now allows to set an error callback
    This callback will be called on errors during device scanning. It defaults
    to a procedure that prints error messages to stderr.
 
* Changes in version 0.1.0 (2020-07-31)
** Release of the first version of Guile-Udev
