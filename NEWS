* Unreleased
** Fixed compilation errors on aarch64
   The naming conflict between variable 'fd_set' and 'typedef(fd_set)' can
   cause compilation errors on aarch64, just like in this issue reported on
   C++: <http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/unices/108481/>

   Now this problem should be fixed.

* Changes in version 0.2.0 (2021-04-11)
** Changes in (udev monitor)
*** Allow to specify 'select' timeout
   The module now provides 'udev-monitor-set-timeout!' procedure that allows
   to specify timeout for calls to 'select'.
*** New procedure 'make-udev-monitor'
    The module now provides two procedures for creating udev monitors:
    low-level '%make-udev-monitor' and high-level 'make-udev-monitor' procedure
    that allows to specify monitor parameters by means of keywords.
*** New procedure 'udev-monitor-set-error-callback!'
    This procedure allows to set a callback that will be called on errors when
    scanner is started.
*** 'make-udev-monitor' now allows to set an error callback
    This callback will be called on errors during device scanning. It defaults
    to a procedure that prints error messages to stderr.
